# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me

My name's Jean-François (call me Jean) and I love coding in my free time. I'm passionate about exploring and creating with technology. Here's a short list of what I can use :

- Programming Languages: Python, Rust (soon enough)
- Database~~s~~: SQLite 3
- Tools: Git, Visual Studio Code, Linux (Fedora & Ubuntu)

I'm constantly learning and improving (hope so) even if I'm often procrastinating and sleeping.

## Projects

### Project 1: Shibbot
